### 1st Commit

Wrote initial HTML & data.py to load csv into HTML dataframe to '/' route.

### 2nd Commit

I want to filter data so I see all Torgersen rows associated with the island attribute. '/torgersen' route

There are missing values that cannot be averaged. I would like to remove any rows that have at least one missing value of NaN

No missing values now. Time to generate individual routes/visualizations.

### 3rd Commit

/torgersen-bodymass route & code created to visualize the average body mass for Males & Females under the Torgersen island attribute.

### 4th Commit

/torgersen-flipperlength route & code created to visualize the average flipper length (mm) for Males & Females under the Torgersen island attribute.

### 5th Commit

/torgersen-culmenlength & /torgersen-culmendepth routes and code created to visualize the avg culmen length and depth for Males & Females under the Torgersen island attribute.
